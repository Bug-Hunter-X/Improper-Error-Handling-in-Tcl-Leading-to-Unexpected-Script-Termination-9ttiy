# Tcl Improper Error Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl programming: improper error handling. The `bug.tcl` file shows a function that throws an error but doesn't handle it gracefully. The `bugSolution.tcl` file shows how to improve this by providing more contextual information when the script exits.
